This repository contains codes, experiment scripts, and datasets to reproduce results of the following papers:

[Realistic Re-evaluation of Knowledge Graph Completion Methods: An Experimental Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08001) Farahnaz Akrami, Mohammed Samiul Saeef, Qingheng Zhang, Wei Hu, and Chengkai Li, SIGMOD 2020

[Re-evaluating Embedding-Based Knowledge Graph Completion Methods](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3269266) Farahnaz Akrami, Lingbing Guo, Wei Hu, and Chengkai Li, CIKM 2018

A summary of the paper is published in a [Medium blog post](https://link.medium.com/lBHwjLeI94).
## Cartesian-product
To find Cartesian Product relations in FB15k and perform link prediction on these relations:
```
python fb15k_cartesian_product.py
```

## Data redundancy
To find the reverse and duplicate relations in FB15k:
```
python FB15k_redundancy.py
```
To find redundant information in test set of FB15k:
```
python FB15k_test_redundancy.py
```

## AMIE
Implementations for conducting link prediction using rules generated by AMIE.
### Run the experiments
Head and tail entity link prediction for a specific test relation:

```
python left.py relation_id
python right.py relation_id
```
Results obtained for each test relation are stored in ./AMIE_LinkPrediction_results. 

To have the results of link prediction using AMIE:
```
python combine_res.py
```

## Models-detailed-results
To obtain the link prediction results for each test relation of FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10:
```
python result_by_rel_all.py
```

To calculate the head and tail entity link prediction results for different relation types:
```
python result_by_relcategory.py
```

Percentage of triples on which each method outperforms others, separately for each relation:

```
python heatmap.py
```

Percentage of test triples with better performance than TransE that have reverse and duplicate triples in training set:

```
python reverse_percentage.py
```

To obtain the number of relations on which each model is the most accurate and charts:

```
python detailed_results.py
```
